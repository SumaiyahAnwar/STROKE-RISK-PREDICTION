# STROKE-RISK-PREDICTION

##Problem Identification:
###Stroke has emerged as a major global cause of mortality and long-term impairment with no proven cure. Predicting stroke risk is based on the dataset features such as hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and blood glucose level parameters. Machine and Deep Learning based models are broadly used to extract significant stroke features for prediction. This work will enhance the performance by using various algorithms such as RF, KNN, CNN, LSTM, and MLP for predicting stroke. The experimental results show the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
